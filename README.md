### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Aakarshan ðŸ˜„

Hi! I'm a Computer Science undergraduate and have a keen interest in software engineering! 
My experience is in making full-stack web applications especially in the Nodejs based tech stacks. 
I'm extremely enthusiastic about learning to build high scale performant and data intensive applications.
I also study about the technological abstractions and the ever increasing complexity of modern software systems. 
I like reading about cloud platforms and their computation modals in product and service based businesses. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Open source projects and my side projects which are mostly full-stack/backend based.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about distributed systems architecture and System design to build scalable, robust and performant applications.
